# IJ-Cohort-14-Boot
My first Bootstrap project

I created 5 Bootstrap designs.

In the Button design, some of the buttons are linked based on the heading.

The "pick your style buttons" and the first button of the "pick your color" are linked to the designs created.
Most of the buttons were not linked because they look alike.
